    <pre>     "my mind is a mountain"

          The cold escapes
          My heart is drenched through
          Fate comes pouring down
          Trip out

          Negative space in cycles
          Been caught on our radar
          We've been waiting here, patiently
          Locked in this state, clocking our time

          The storm remains
          And my heart's entrenched
          New fate explores me now
          Trip out

          Why do we bathe in this psyche?
          Remain calm in our mental
          We display it in our patience
          Locked in this stage, plotting our time

          Now we sail (into)
          The storm implodes (around)
          Exploring your fate
          Now we sail, starting now (behold)

          Negative space in cycles
          Destroying our mental
          Remains in our conscious
          Constant  </pre>
